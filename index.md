## Vasculature Dataset Analysis and Visualization
VesselVio is an open-source application designed to allow researchers to analyze and visualize segmented and binarized vasculature datasets. It is also compatible with annotated datasets and pre-constructed graphs made in other programs.

## Using VesselVio
In an attempt to tackel large learning-curves imposed by terminal-based analysis software, we sought to build an open-source and stand-alone application for [Windows and MacOS](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Downloads.html). The app's user-interface allows for users to easily load datasets for analysis and visualization with specific parameters. The application can also be run from the terminal by following our step-by-step [Build Instructions](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Build.html).

## Instructions 
Tutorials on how to use VesselVio to analyze your vasculature datasets can be found on the [Tutorial Page](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Instructions.html). It's important to remember that the application was built for the analysis of segmented datasets. If you're looking for resources to segment your datasets, you can check out [ClearMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/home.html), [VesSAP](https://github.com/vessap/vessap), or [DeepVesselNet](https://github.com/giesekow/deepvesselnet) as a few starting resources. Of course, there are many more. 

If you're looking for help with annotating your whole-brain vasculature datasets, we'd recommend that you check out [QuickNII](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii/). 

## Download
Currently, VesselVio is available for download as a standalone application for computers running MacOS 11.6+ and Windows 10. 

This application is entirely open-source and free to download under the [GNU GPLv3 license](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio/blob/main/LICENSE). Reseachers hoping to modify or use individual components of the application's software can find the sourcecode on the [GitHub VesselVio page](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio).
