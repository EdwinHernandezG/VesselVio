## Analysis
VesselVio works with any binarized and segmented vasculature dataset to provide large-scale and individual-segment qualitative features. We have tested analysis on datasets acquired with light-sheet microscopy, micro-computed tomography, and magnetic resonance angiography. Examples of dataset analyses can be found in our recent [pre-print publication](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-608609/private/preview).

## Visualization
Visualization of analyzed datasets can also be completed to manually inspect the results with the original and mesh-surface smoothed datasets.

## Download
Currently, VesselVio is available for download as a standalone application for computers running MacOS 10.15.17+ and Windows 10. If you would rather run the VesselVio from the command-line, instructions for python virtual environment builds on MacOS and Windows are found on the left side-bar.


This application is entirely open-source and free to download under [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio/blob/main/LICENSE).
