## Analysis
VesselVio works with any binarized and segmented vasculature dataset to provide large-scale and individual-segment qualitative features. We have tested analysis on datasets acquired with light-sheet microscopy, micro-computed tomography, and magnetic resonance angiography. Examples of dataset analyses can be found in our recent [pre-print publication]().

## Visualization
Visualization of analyzed datasets can also be completed to manually inspect the results with the original and mesh-surface smoothed datasets.
